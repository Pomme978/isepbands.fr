Our association organizes several concerts and other musical activities each year, such as jams, studio rehearsals and themed afterwork events. ISEPBANDS was behind the creation of our flagship event: the Battle of the Bands (BOTB), which was long organized with other engineering schools: EPITA and EFREI. After these wonderful years, we are planning to revisit this Battle as a new event: our new bi-annual concert, which we also want to share with other highly motivated schools! For many years, the association organized recording studios that allowed musicians to record their band covers, and this year we have decided to bring them back!',
